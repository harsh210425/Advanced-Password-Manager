## 💻 Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Structure and layout.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Modern, responsive styling and Glassmorphism design.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Core logic, DOM manipulation, and XOR encryption algorithm.

## ✨ Key Features
1.  **🔒 Secure Local Storage:** Data is encrypted before being saved to the browser's LocalStorage. No data is ever sent to a server.
2.  **💪 Strength Indicator:** Real-time visual feedback on password strength (Weak/Medium/Strong).
3.  **⚡ Password Generator:** instantly creates strong, random passwords.
4.  **⚠️ Security Audits:**
    * **Weak Password Detection:** Alerts you if saved passwords are too simple.
    * **Reused Password Detection:** Identifies if you are using the same password for multiple sites.
5.  **👁️ Visibility Toggle:** Click the "Eye" icon to reveal or hide encrypted passwords.
6.  **📋 One-Click Copy:** Easily copy passwords to your clipboard.
